1. Java Generics Viva Questions

Q1: What is a generic class?
A: A generic class allows type parameters, so a single class can work with different data types without rewriting code.

Q2: What is a generic method?
A: A method with its own type parameter <T> that can operate on objects of various types.

Q3: What are wildcards in Java Generics?
A: ? represents an unknown type.

<?> → any type

<? extends T> → T or subclasses

<? super T> → T or superclasses

2. Java Collections – List

Q4: Difference between List, ArrayList, and LinkedList?
A:

List is an interface.

ArrayList → dynamic array, fast random access.

LinkedList → doubly linked list, fast insert/delete.

Q5: How do you iterate over a List?
A: Using for-each, Iterator, or ListIterator.

Q6: Difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
A:

Iterator → forward only.

ListIterator → forward and backward, can modify list during iteration.

3. Java Collections – Set

Q7: Difference between Set and List?
A:

Set → no duplicate elements, unordered.

List → ordered, allows duplicates.

Q8: Difference between HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet?
A:

HashSet → unordered

LinkedHashSet → insertion order

TreeSet → sorted order

Q9: How to check if an item exists in a Set?
A: Using contains() method.

4. Java Collections – Map

Q10: Difference between Map and Set?
A:

Map → key-value pairs

Set → only values (no duplicates)

Q11: Difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
A:

HashMap → unordered, allows null key

TreeMap → sorted by key, no null key

Q12: How to retrieve value for a key?
A: Using get(key) method.

Q13: How to iterate over a Map?
A: Using entrySet() with for-each or iterator.

5. Lambda Expressions

Q14: What is a lambda expression?
A: A concise way to represent an anonymous function (implementation of functional interface).

Q15: Syntax of a lambda with no parameter?
A: () -> System.out.println("Hello World");

Q16: Lambda with one parameter?
A: x -> x * x;

Q17: Lambda with multiple parameters?
A: (a, b) -> a + b;

Q18: Can a lambda return a value?
A: Yes, if the functional interface method has a return type.

Q19: Difference between lambda and anonymous inner class?
A: Lambda is more concise, cannot have constructors, focuses on behavior.

6. JSP

Q20: What is JSP?
A: Java Server Pages – allows embedding Java code in HTML to create dynamic web pages.

Q21: Difference between JSP declarations, scriptlets, and expressions?
A:

Declaration <%! %> → declare variables/methods

Scriptlet <% %> → execute Java code

Expression <%= %> → output value

Q22: What is JSP directive?
A: Instructions to JSP engine, e.g., <%@ page %>

Q23: How to connect JSP to database?
A: Using JDBC API and configuring driver, connection, statements.

Q24: Difference between include and forward in JSP?
A:

include → includes content at runtime

forward → transfers control to another resource

7. Spring Framework

Q25: What is Spring?
A: Lightweight framework for building Java applications with dependency injection and AOP.

Q26: What is dependency injection (DI)?
A: Technique where Spring injects required objects instead of creating them manually.

Q27: Types of DI in Spring?
A: Constructor-based and setter-based.

Q28: What is Autowiring?
A: Spring automatically injects dependencies without explicit configuration.

Q29: What is Spring AOP?
A: Aspect-Oriented Programming – separates cross-cutting concerns like logging, security.

Q30: Types of AOP advice?
A: Before, After, After-returning, After-throwing, Around.

Q31: What is a pointcut?
A: Expression that defines which methods should have advice applied.
